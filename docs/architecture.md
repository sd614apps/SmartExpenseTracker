# System Design for a Simple Manual Entry Expense Tracker
This system design provides a robust foundation for the initial manual entry expense tracker, with clear paths for future scalability and feature enhancements.

## 1. Architecture Overview
The app will be designed using a client-server architecture where the client (mobile app) interacts with the backend server through RESTful APIs. The backend will handle user authentication, data storage, and processing, while the frontend (mobile app) will manage the user interface and interaction.

## 2. High-Level Components
### Frontend (Mobile App)

- Platform: Native apps for Android and iOS (using Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS, or a cross-platform framework like Flutter/React Native).
- UI/UX: Design a simple and intuitive user interface that supports all the core features like expense entry, budget management, and data visualization.
- API Client: The app will use an API client to communicate with the backend server for tasks such as user authentication, data sync, and retrieving analytics.

### Backend (Server)

- Authentication Service: Manages user registration, login, and password recovery. This could be handled by services like Firebase Authentication or custom JWT-based authentication.

#### Expense Management API:
- Create Expense: API to log a new expense.
- Update/Delete Expense: APIs to update or delete existing expense entries.
- Get Expenses: API to retrieve expenses, filtered by date, category, etc.

#### Budget Management API:
- Set/Get Budget: APIs to set and retrieve user budgets.
- Budget Tracking: Track and notify users about their spending relative to their budget.

#### Analytics Engine:
- Spending Insights: Generate and serve analytics like category breakdown, spending trends, etc.
- Notifications: Trigger budget alerts and summaries based on user preferences.
- Database: Stores all user data, including expense entries, budget settings, user profiles, and authentication tokens.
- Security: Ensures data is securely stored and transmitted. Use HTTPS for all API calls and encrypt sensitive data in the database.

### Database

- Database Type: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data storage.
#### Schema Design:
- Users Table: Stores user information (ID, email, hashed password, preferences).
- Expenses Table: Stores expense data (ID, user ID, amount, category, date, payment method, description).
- Budgets Table: Stores budget information for each user, linked to specific categories.
- Categories Table: Stores default and user-defined categories.
- Data Indexing: Optimize performance for querying expenses by date, category, and user ID.

### Cloud Storage (Optional)

- User Data Backup: Optionally, store user backups (e.g., CSV exports) in a secure cloud storage like AWS S3.
- Data Sync: Allow syncing data across multiple devices by storing the latest data version in the cloud.

### Notification Service

- Push Notifications: Use services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications for budget alerts, daily/weekly summaries, and custom reminders.
- Email Notifications: Optionally, send summary reports or alerts via email using services like SendGrid or Amazon SES.

### Admin Panel (Optional)

- User Management: Interface for managing users, including viewing user data and activity logs.
- Analytics Dashboard: Provide admins with insights into app usage, popular categories, and overall spending trends among users.
#### 1. Data Flow
##### User Registration/Login:

- User submits registration/login details through the app.
- App sends a request to the backend authentication service.
- Backend validates and returns a JWT token to the app.
- Token is stored securely on the device for subsequent API requests.

##### Expense Entry:

- User enters expense details in the app.
- App sends a POST request to the backend with the expense data.
- Backend stores the expense in the database and returns a success response.
- App updates the UI to reflect the new expense.

##### Budget Management:

- User sets a budget through the app.
- App sends a POST/PUT request to the backend with the budget details.
- Backend saves the budget and tracks expenses against it.
- Alerts are generated based on spending patterns and sent to the app.

##### Analytics and Insights:

- User requests an overview of their spending.
- App sends a GET request to the backend for spending data.
- Backend processes the request, retrieves the necessary data, and sends it back to the app.
- App displays insights like category breakdowns and spending trends.

##### Notifications:

- Backend monitors spending relative to set budgets.
- When a budget threshold is reached, the backend triggers a notification.
- Notification service sends a push notification to the user's device.

## 4. Technology Stack
### Frontend:

- Languages: Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS), or Dart (Flutter) for cross-platform.
- UI Frameworks: Android SDK, UIKit (iOS), or Flutter/React Native.
- State Management: Redux or Provider (for Flutter/React Native).

### Backend:

- Languages: Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, or Java with Spring Boot.
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL for relational data.
- Authentication: Firebase Auth or JWT-based custom authentication.
- Hosting: AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for backend services.
- APIs: RESTful APIs for communication between the app and server.

### Security:

- HTTPS: For secure data transmission.
- Encryption: AES for sensitive data storage, bcrypt for password hashing.
- Access Control: Role-based access control for admin panel.

### Notifications:

- Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
- Email Notifications: SendGrid, Amazon SES, or similar services.

### DevOps:

- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI for automated testing and deployment.
- Monitoring: New Relic, Datadog, or similar tools for backend performance monitoring.
- Version Control: Git with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for source code management.

## 1. Scalability and Future Enhancements
- Scalability: Design the backend to be scalable, with load balancers and auto-scaling groups to handle increasing user demand.
- Modularity: Keep the architecture modular to easily integrate future enhancements like automatic expense tracking or AI-powered insights.
- Microservices (Future): Consider breaking down the monolithic backend into microservices if the user base grows significantly, enabling more granular scaling and independent service updates.
